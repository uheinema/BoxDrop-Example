This process was identified by Armand Sabbatier in 1860, involving partial solarization of high contrast prints, during the development process.

Sabatier (often misspelled Sabattier) was a doctor of medicine in the small French village of Saint-Mammers. He has been regularly confused with Armand Sabatier, a marine zoologist of the era, who published nothing on photography.

The effect was first described in print by H. de la Blanchere in 1859 in L’Art du Photographe.  It was described again in 1860 by L.M. Rutherford and C.A. Seely, separately, in successive issues of The American Journal of Photography, and in the same year by Count Schouwaloff in the French publication Cosmos.  By rights the phenomenon should have been christened the Blanchere Effect, for it was not described by Sabatier until later in 1860 in Cosmos.  Sabatier must have been aware of Schouwaloff's earlier paper in the same publication, but he makes no mention of it.
